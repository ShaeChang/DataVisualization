# Replication of figure 6-15 -------------------------------------------

# This graph tries to replicate a bubble chart that introduces a third 
# dimension of state population in visualization of the relationship between the
# burglary rate and the murder rate.

# Referred from graph 6-15 in than Yauâ€™s book Visualize This.
